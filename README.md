Best Model Selection:

Choose the model with highest R², lowest RMSE/MAE, and good visual fit.

Typically: Gradient Boosting or Random Forest > Linear Regression for car prices.

Understanding Predictions:

Feature importance explains why the model predicts a certain price.

Example: Older car + higher mileage → lower predicted selling price.

Model Reliability:

Consistent performance on test set → model can be used for real-world price prediction or dashboard.
